Evaluate system resilience:

Check for:

1. TIMEOUT HANDLING
    - HTTP request timeouts
    - Database query timeouts
    - Long-running operation limits

2. RETRY LOGIC
    - Exponential backoff
    - Maximum retry limits
    - Idempotency considerations

3. CIRCUIT BREAKER PATTERN
    - Service failure detection
    - Fallback mechanisms
    - Recovery testing

4. BULKHEAD PATTERN
    - Resource isolation
    - Thread pool separation
    - Connection pool limits

5. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION
    - Feature flags
    - Fallback data sources
    - Cached responses
    - Default values

Rate resilience (1-10) with improvement recommendations.

## Provide:

A structured finding report

A scale of 1/10 on how important each finding is

Remediation: precise code-level fix or config change (snippets welcome) if possible

## Constraints & style:

Be concrete and cite exact code locations and identifiers.

Prefer minimal, drop-in fix snippets over prose.

Do not invent files or functions that aren’t present; if context is missing, mark as Unable to verify and say what code would prove it.

Write this into a markdown file and place it in the audits/ folder.
