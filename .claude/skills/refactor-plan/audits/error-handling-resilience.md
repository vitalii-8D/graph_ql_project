Evaluate this entire software package.

Perform a comprehensive error handling review:

Evaluate:

1. ERROR HANDLING CONSISTENCY
    - Is there a centralized error handler?
    - Are errors handled uniformly?
    - Custom error classes vs generic errors?

2. ERROR CATEGORIES
    - Validation errors (400)
    - Authentication errors (401)
    - Authorization errors (403)
    - Not found errors (404)
    - Server errors (500)
    - Rate limit errors (429)
    - Are they properly categorized?

3. ASYNC ERROR HANDLING
    - Unhandled promise rejections
    - Async middleware wrapper usage
    - Callback error handling
    - Event emitter error handling

4. ERROR RECOVERY
    - Graceful degradation
    - Retry mechanisms
    - Circuit breakers
    - Fallback strategies

5. ERROR INFORMATION
    - Development vs production error details
    - Stack trace exposure
    - Error logging completeness
    - User-friendly error messages

Identify error handling gaps and provide improved implementation.

## Provide:

A structured finding report

A scale of 1/10 on how important each finding is

Remediation: precise code-level fix or config change (snippets welcome) if possible

## Constraints & style:

Be concrete and cite exact code locations and identifiers.

Prefer minimal, drop-in fix snippets over prose.

Do not invent files or functions that aren’t present; if context is missing, mark as Unable to verify and say what code would prove it.

Write this into a markdown file and place it in the audits/ folder.
